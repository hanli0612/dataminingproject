* **business_checkin_dump.py:**
  The script reads business.json and checkin.json and dumps to business collection in yelpdb
  It generates the db so no need to run it. This is only for demonstration
  
* **citystatecounting.py:** 
  It counts how many businesses in each state, how many businesses in each city
